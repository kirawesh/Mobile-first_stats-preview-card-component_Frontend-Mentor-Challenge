# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

## Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

In this solution I re-did it again and this time according to the mobile first approach. I also wanted to try using a 12-column approach, but this wasn't the right project for that. I searched through a lot of options, and it still didn't work well in terms of the placement of the elements. I learned from this that it is more suitable for pages than for specific elements of cards, models, etc. Regarding mobile- first approach, I'm not sure if I'm writing less code, but I notice that I have more control and actually a little less responsiveness between the breakpoints. So maybe there is a more accurate approach to do this. Not sure what the guidelines are for that.
